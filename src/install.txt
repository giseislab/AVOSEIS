Installation procedure for the AVOSEIS package on your filesystem
-----------------------------------------------------------------

# If $AVOSEIS and $AVOSEISMAKE already exist:
	make update
	# make update calls make clean, make Include, make install, make schemas, make pf_localmods

# Otherwise:
	cd adm/coldstart
	make
	cd ../..
	mkdir -p ${AVOSEIS}/man/man1
	mkdir -p ${AVOSEIS}/man/man5
	make update
	# You will want to source $AVOSEIS/setup.sh in your .bashrc file (if you use bash)
	# or $AVOSEIS/setup.csh in your .(t)cshrc file (if you use (t)csh).

# Additional steps for real-time servers only
	make host 
	make html

Rebuild $AVOSEISMAKE
--------------------
# This should not be necessary, but if you need to rebuild $AVOSEISMAKE, do this:
	cd lib/makerules
	make Include
	make update

Testing and rebuilding the Perl modules 
---------------------------------------

# (not needed during a regular update)

	# Currently there is only one Perl module - Avoseis::SwarmAlarm
	cd data/perl/Avoseis-SwarmAlarm

	# Clean the Module installation, including the Makefile
	make clean

	# Create the Makefile
	perl Makefile.PL

	# Test the Perl module - currently failing because cannot load Datascope.pm
	make test

	# If desired, build the Perl module (executable, perldoc entry, man page)
	# Executable goees to: /opt/antelope/perl5.10-64/lib/site_perl/5.10.0/Avoseis
	# Manpage goes to something like blib/lib/...
	# (note "make update" also calls "make install", and so does these things)
	make install

.SH NAME
dbalarmdispatch \- dispatch an alarm to a call-down list of recipients
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbalarmdispatch [-p pffile] [-t runtime] [-d] [-v] alarmid alarmdb\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbalarmdispatch\fR is run for a particular alarmid of an alarms table,
and dispatches the alarm with subject as given in that record, and a pre-formed message which is
stored in a reference pointed to by the dir & dfile fields.
.LP
Alarms are dispatched to recipients as defined in the parameter file. There is a
default block which gives a default list of recipients. Each recipient has a delay
time, in seconds. An alarm is dispatched to a recipient when this delay time is met.
This allows a call-down list to be implemented whereby recipients get the alarms at
different times.
.LP
A related program, confirm_alarms.php, allows users to acknowledgment an alarm they
have received, and doing so will stop the call-down at that point. This sets the
acknowledged field in the alarms record to 1.
.LP
If the recipient list needs to be tweaked for a particular alarm algorithm name
(alarmname) then a separate block can be added in the parameter file. Recipients are
added to the default list.
.LP
To test this program, call with the -d flag and that message will
be dispatched (again). The -d flag simply resets the acknowledged field back to 0.
In this mode, runTime is set to alarmtime, so that the latency < max_ack_wait_sec
condition does not stop the program executing. The alarm is dispatched, but the
subject of the message is changed to "TEST". Test alarms can also be acknowledged
in the usual way through confirm_alarms.php.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p pffile"
\fIpffile\fP is the full path to the parameter file. If omitted, the
parameter file used is the result of 'pfecho dbalarmdispatch'.
.IP -v
Be more verbose
.IP -d
Test mode. Resets the 'acknowledged' field to false (0). The message will be (re-)dispatched
but with the subject changed to 'TEST'.
.IP "-t runtime"
Force the timewindow to end at runtime, rather than now.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
The \fBdbalarmdispatch\fP parameter file contains parameters that
control what should happen when an alarms record is dispatched.

Following is an example \fBdbalarmdispatch\fP parameter file. For
alarmname 'swarm_RD', recipients will be:
glennthompson1971@gmail.com	0
avors.tech@gmail.com 30
glenn@giseis.alaska.edu 60
9076877747@mms.att.net  0

This means that after 0 seconds, the alarm will be sent to glennthompson1971@gmail.com
and 9076877747@mms.att.net. If not cancelled after 30 seconds, the alarm will be sent to
avors.tech@gmail.com. If not cancelled after 60 seconds, the alarm will be sent to
glenn@giseis.alaska.edu.

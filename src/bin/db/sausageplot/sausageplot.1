# This is a template for a standard Antelope man page.  
# After you've filled in the necessary fields, 
# delete the lines beginning with "#"
# with a command like: "sed '/^#/d'". 
#
# Look at your formatted man page after installing it, using man
# or:
#	 % nroff -man manpage.1 | more
#
# The fixman utility can review your manpage and suggest corrections 
#
# If you write a man page which describes several routines 
# or commands, you should have a man "page" named after each routine or 
# command.  One will have the actual description in it, the others will
# just include the first with a line like:
# .so man3/malloc.3v
#
# The following line is for man pages which use tbl or eqn; it 
# causes man to run tbl and/or eqn on the man page.  If the man page
# doesn't require these, the line should be deleted.

# Describe input and output files (but not down to bits).
#
.SH ENVIRONMENT

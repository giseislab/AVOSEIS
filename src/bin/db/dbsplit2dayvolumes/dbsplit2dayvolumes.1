.TH DBSPLIT2DAYVOLUMES 1 2010/03/10 "BRTT Antelope 4.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
dbsplit2dayvolumes \- Split an event database into day volumes.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbsplit2dayvolumes [-d] [-v] [-n Ndays] dbin dbout [yyyy-mm-dd]\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbsplit2dayvolumes\fR reads an input event database and splits out the last full UT day
into an output event database. This can be overridden with the -n nDays argument which
will try to split out the UT day from nDays UT days ago. This should be a positive
integer from 1 to 365 (default is 1).
.LP
If a date in the form yyyy-mm-dd is also added, that UT day will be selected instead.
This overrides the -n nDays argument.
.LP
If the -d switch is used, the selected records are deleted from the input database.
That is, -d is like a move command. Otherwise, the records are only copied.
.LP
Links are also created for future days not yet split out.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Be more verbose
.IP -d
Delete records from the input database. Otherwise they are left intact.
.IP "-n nDays"
Split out the UT day from nDays UT days ago instead (ignored if yyyy-mm-dd is given).

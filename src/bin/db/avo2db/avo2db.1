.SH NAME
avo2db \- convert AVO-style Hypoellipse "pick files" to hypocenter database table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBavo2db \fP[-v] 
               Usage: avo2db [-v]
               [-r \fIreference_db[:reference_db...\fP]]
               \fIpickfile [pickfile...]\fP
               \fIdbname\fP 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBavo2db\fP maps hypocenter solutions from the pick file format used by the Alaska Volcano Observatory into Antelope database tables. \fBavo2db\fP is a heavy-handed modification of \fBpick2db\fP to address specific issues and needs encountered with AVO hypocenters. USers are encouraged to read the man page for \fBpick2db\fP and then note the differences below.
.LP
(1) \fBavo2db\fP creates real channel names when used with suitable pick files. The -c and -p flags from \fBpick2db\fP have been disabled. Three letter channel names have been in pickfiles since mid-1997. Prior to 1997 \fBavo2db\fP assigns a channel name SH?. This is consistent with the segmented data files that accompany pickfiles.
.br
(2) \fBavo2db\fP assigns id numbers that are based on the month the data was recorded. Each month has unique id numbers that allow month databases to be concatonated together without renumbering. This numbering scheme relies on databases being created one month at a time. This is reasonable however as this is how AVO pickfiles are stored.
.br
(3) A remark table is produced by \fBavo2db\fP. When joined with the origin table (using the commid), each row will have a remark which includes the original pickfile name from which the data is derived.
.br
(4) Error ellipse information is generated by project_ellipse_avo instead of project_ellipse. For reasons unknown, project_ellipse no longer appears to return error information consistent with the pickfile (or consistent with its own man page?!). \fBproject_ellipse_avo\fP is a modest revision by M. Thorne that appears to correctly handle error info. Note that the output of \fBproject_ellipse\fP and \fBproject_ellipse_avo\fP have not been rigorously tested. However, the results of \fBproject_ellipse\fP are clearly incorrect.

This program was written to address specific needs when working with data from AVO.

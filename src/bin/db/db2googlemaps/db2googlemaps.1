.SH NAME
db2googlemaps \- Create an xml-formatted version of hypocenter solutions.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdb2googlemaps\fP [-sob] \fIdbname\fP > \fIxml_file\fP 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdb2googlemaps\fP This script creates a xml file in a format suitable for use with the AVO public Google Maps pages. It uses event or station information extracted from the input database. At least one of the -s, -o and -b option flags must be used or the resulting xml file will be empty. 

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -s
create placemarks for all seismic stations in database.
.IP -o
creates placemarks for all preferred origins. This option requires the origin, event and netmag tables. Origin placemarks are colored by depth. Size is scaled by origin magnitude.
.IP -b
creates basic placemarks for all origins. This is a simplified version of the -o flag that reads only an origin table. The same color and depth scale is used as for -o. A single magnitude is assigned in the order of preference: Ms, mb, ml. Either the -o or -b should be used, but not both.
.IP -x
Export XML in VOLC2 format. If omitted, XML format is similar to that exported by db2avoxml.
.IP -f
force program to include all origins. By default only the first 300 are included in the output.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
$ANTELOPE and $AVOSEIS must be set.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
None.

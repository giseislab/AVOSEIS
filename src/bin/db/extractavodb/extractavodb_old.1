.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBextractavodb_old\fP is the version of extractavodb that has long been used at AVO. However, the version in AVOSEIS was upgraded to include additional functionality, while extractavodb continued to be used on the Linux network. This older version is preserved here and should be until extractavodb has been shown to work in all situations where the Linux version was previously used.

.IP -f

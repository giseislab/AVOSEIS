.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdb2volc2\fP This script is the interface between a version of the AVO event catalog that exists in a CSS3.0 Datascope database, and the Google Maps application "VOLC2", originally developed by Jon Connolly and Wes Thelen at PNSN. Given a parameter file with a list of volcanoes and corresponding geographic coordinates and zoom levels, \fBdb2volc2\fP makes 3 calls to db2googlemapsproduces. This yields 3 XML files for each volcano: origins_$volcano.xml, origins_$volcano_lastweek.xml and stations_$volcano.xml. Origins and stations are selected using a circular geographical filter centred on the given coordinates and with a radius determined by the zoom level.

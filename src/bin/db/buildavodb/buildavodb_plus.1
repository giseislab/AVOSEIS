.SH NAME
buildavodb_plus \- convert several months of AVO pick files to database tables.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBbuildavodb_plus\fP [startYear startMonth] [endYear endMonth] [output_database]
  
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbuildavodb_plus\fP converts several months of AVO pick files into Antelope database and can use an optional output database rather than the default monthly AVO CSS3.0 databases. It should be fully compatible with calls to \fBbuildavodb\fP as it is a generalized version of the same code, originally created to help convert AVO pickfiles in real-time to create an XPICK CSS3.0 database at /avort/oprun/events/xpick/events_xpick. 

.SH OPTIONS
none.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
$ANTELOPE and $AVOSEIS must be set. \fBavo2db\fP must be in the path.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
None.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
avo2db(1), buildavodb(1)

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
All the same caveats apply as noted in the \fBbuildavodb\fP man page, plus this more generalized version has been far less tested. 
.PP
It seems more likely that \fBwatchpickfiles2db\fP may have been the version that was actually used to create the real-time XPICK
database. Those code changes have been incorporated here, but are commented out and well documented. They should probably be added
back. It looks like \fBwatchpickfiles2db\fP checked the database to see which pickfiles had already been translated and did not
repeat them. It also uses a different method to loop over multiple months.

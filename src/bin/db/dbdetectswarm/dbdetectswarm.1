.SH NAME
dbdetectswarm \- declare a new swarm, or the escalation, continuation or end
of a swarm, depending on event parameters.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdbdetectswarm [-p pffile] [-t endtime] [-d] [-v] [-r] eventdb alarmdb swarmdb\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdbdetectswarm\fR reads an event database for a given timewindow, and determines
if the rate of events, or the magnitudes of those events, warrants the declaration
of an alarm. An alarm can be issued for a new swarm, the escalation of an ongoing
swarm, or the end of a swarm. Reminder alarms can also be issued regarding the
continuation of an ongoing swarm after a specified period of time. Declaring an
alarm means a new record gets written to the alarms table of the output alarm database.
.LP
\fBdbdetectswarm\fR examines the last timewindow minutes of the eventdb datatabase,
where timewindow is set in the parameter file. Loads a list of event times and magnitudes,
and from this determines the mean hourly event rate, median hourly event rate, mean magnitude (ml)
and cumulative magnitude of events in that timewindow. These are termed mean_rate, median_rate,
mean_ml and cum_ml respectively.
.LP
Reads the alarms table looking for the most recent message of alarm algorithm name alarmname as
set in the parameter file. Reads the associated swarm message parameter file. This contains
information about the previous message declared about this swarm, including it's swarm_end time.
If swarm_end time is non-positive, it means the swarm has not ended.
.LP
If the previous message indicates the swarm has ended (swarm_end > 0) check if the new_alarm
threshold is exceeded. The compulsory threshold parameter that must be checked is the mean_rate.
Optionally, thresholds for median_rate, mean_ml and cum_ml can also be set in the parameter file.
If optional thresholds are specified, all conditions must be met for a new swarm alarm to be
declared.
.LP
If swarm_end <= 0, a swarm is still considered to be continuing. Nevertheless, the swarm may have
 ended since that previous message, or it may have escalated. So those conditions are checked for.
In the parameter file there is a significant change hash, where percentage changes in mean_rate,
median_rate and absolute changes in mean_ml and cum_ml can be specified (the first is compulsory,
the latter 3 are optional). So if there has been a 'significant' increase in swarm parameters since
the previous message about this swarm, a swarm escalation alarm is declared. Otherwise, if swarm
parameters are now significantly below the new swarm alarm threshold, the end of that swarm is
declared.
.LP
If none of these conditions are true, the swarm is continuing at approximately the same level. So
the final check is to see if more than REMINDER_TIME minutes have passed since the previous message
about this alarm. If so, a swarm reminder is sent.
.LP
If an alarm is declared, a row is written to the alarms table in alarmdb, linking to an external
message file.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-p pffile"
\fIpffile\fP is the full path to the parameter file. If omitted, the
parameter file used is the result of 'pfecho dbdetectswarm'.
.IP "-r replay"
Do not look for new records since the last time \fBdbdetectswarm\fR ran.
\fIrecordno\fP is the record of the database to start processing at. If omitted,
\fBdbdetectswarm\fR will start at the end of the table.
.IP -v
Be more verbose
.IP -d
Test mode. An alarm of alarmname 'test' will be declared regardless of how many
events occurred in the given time window.
.IP "-t endtime"
Force the timewindow to end at endtime, rather than now. So new alarm rows might get written,
based on historic data. Use this carefully, as new records corresponding to old database could
get written at the end of an existing database. So when running on old datasets, it is better to
create a new database.

.SH FILES
To track changes in an input event database between successive runs of \fBdbdetectswarm\fR, a
tracking parameter file is used. This way if  \fBdbdetectswarm\fR is run as a cronjob, it can
still tell when the event database changes. The tracking parameter file path is specified in
\fIpffile\fP.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
The \fBdbdetectswarm\fP parameter file contains parameters that
control what should happen when new records are detected in the input
database event table.
Following is an example \fBdbdetectswarm\fP parameter file.

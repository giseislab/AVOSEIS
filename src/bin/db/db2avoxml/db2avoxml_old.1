.TH DB2AVOXML [DEPRECATED] 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
db2avoxml_old \- Deprecated but robust version of db2avoxml.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBdb2avoxml_old\fP [-sob] \fIdbname\fP > \fIxml_file\fP 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdb2avoxml_old\fP This script creates a xml file in a format suitable for use with the AVO public Google Maps pages. It uses event or station information extracted from the input database. At least one option flag must be used or the resulting xml file will be empty. To maintain a quick response when used with Google Maps, output is currently limited to the first 300 events. This limit can be overridden with the -f flag.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -s
create placemarks for all seismic stations in database.
.IP -o
creates placemarks for all preferred origins. This option requires the origin, event and netmag tables. Origin placemarks are colored by depth. Size is scaled by origin magnitude.
.IP -b
creates basic placemarks for all origins. This is a simplified version of the -o flag that reads only an origin table. The same color and depth scale is used as for -o. A single magnitude is assigned in the order of preference: Ms, mb, ml. Either the -o or -b should be used, but not both.
.IP -f
force program to include all origins. By default only the first 300 are included in the output.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
$ANTELOPE and $AVOSEIS must be set.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
None.

.SH BUGS AND CAVEATS
At the time of writing this I don't recall the difference between -b and -o. In some (all?) cases they return the same information. It is possible that -b is obsolete.
.LP
Part of the reason this module has been deprecated is because there are at least 3 different versions which represent different stages of this module developed by Mike West and added to AVOSEIS at different times. It is only worth reconciling which code is "correct" or merging these versions if \fBdb2avoxml\fP does not fulfill your needs.
.LP
Numerous subsets of placemarks may be desirable - stations in a date range, origins in a magnitude range. \fBdb2avoxml\fP allows subsetting through a command-line option. These options are not coded into db2avoxml_old and should be carried out on the input database prior to sending to \fBdb2avoxml_old\fP.

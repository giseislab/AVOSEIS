.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBproject_ellipse_avo\fP reads hypocenter error parameters created by Hypoellipse and projects them onto an error ellipse and depth error more compatible with a css3.0 database. \fBproject_ellipse_avo\fP is a version of \fBproject_ellipse\fP modified by M. Thorne in 2007. For reasons unknown, \fBproject_ellipse\fP is not producing appropriate errors. Particularly suspect is the fact the that example given on the project_ellipse man page does not return the anticipated value (last accessed 2011). \fBproject_ellipse_avo\fP was modified just slightly. The routine has been validated using error projections carried out with independent Matlab codes.

This program was written to address specific needs when working with data from AVO.

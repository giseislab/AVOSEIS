.TH VOLCANOVIEWS2VOLC2 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
volcanoeviws2volc2 \- Create XML feeds for the VOLC2 Google Maps application.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBvolcanoviews2volc2\fP  \fIdbname\fP > \fIxml_directory\fP 
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvolcanoviews2volc2\fP This script is the interface between a version of the AVO event catalog (that exists in either a CSS3.0 Datascope database or a VALVE Hypocenters table), and the Google Maps application "VOLC2", originally developed by Jon Connolly and Wes Thelen at PNSN. Given a parameter file with a list of volcanoes and corresponding geographic coordinates and zoom levels, \fBvolcanoviews2volc2\fP makes 3 calls to db2googlemaps (for a Datascope database) or valve2volc2 (for a VALVE Hypocenters table). Which of these two modes to use is specified with a command-line switch . This yields 3 XML files for each volcano: origins_$volcano.xml, origins_$volcano_lastweek.xml and stations_$volcano.xml. Origins and stations are selected using a circular geographical filter centred on the given coordinates and with a radius determined by the zoom level.

.SH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
.IP dbname
The path to the CSS3.0 Datascope database.
.IP xml_directory
The path to the directory to write the XML files to.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-s SOURCE"
SOURCE is either "Datascope" or "VALVE". If omitted, it defaults to "VALVE", which
will assume that the correct VALKVE JSP to use is specified in the parameter file.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
$ANTELOPE and $AVOSEIS must be set.

.SH PARAMETER FILE
This is volcanoviews2volc2.pf on the PFPATH. Parameters are: 
.PP
STATIONDB - the path of the Datascope database containing station coordinates.
.PP
EVENTDB - the path of the Datascope database containing event lat/lon/depth/magnitudes. This is not needed
in the default mode where SOURCE=VALVE.
.PP
VALVEJSP - the path of the VALVE Java Server Page which services requests to VDX.

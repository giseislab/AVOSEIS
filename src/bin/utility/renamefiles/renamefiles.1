.TH RENAMEFILES 1 2007/03/12 "BRTT Antelope 4.11" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
.nf
renamefiles - rename a group of files (such as a Datascope database)
.fi
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
renamefiles  matchstr replacestr
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrenamefiles\fP is a simple Perl script that searches for all files in the local directory whose filenames start with a particular string provided in the first command line argument, and substitutes another string provided in the second command line argument. Its particularly useful for renaming a Datascope database, without having to write an inline foreach loop or tediously issuing a "mv" command for each file. Think of it as the equivalent of the ed, vi or Perl regular expression "s/matchstr/replacestr/g" but on filenames rather than strings in a file.
.LP
Its rather like being able to run a command like:
.PP
mv (matchstr)foo.bar (replacestr)foo.bar
.SH OPTIONS
These are identical to dbevents, except for the addition of:
.IP "matchstr"
The substring in the names of the source files to replace.
.IP "replacestr"
The substring with which to replace 'matchstr'

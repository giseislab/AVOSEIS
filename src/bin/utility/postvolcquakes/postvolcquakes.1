.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpostvolcquakes\fP is a tool to create a readable html-formatted catalog of recent earthquakes. In several aspects, it is well tailored to posting volcanic earthquake catalogs. Good features include: (1) Awareness of volcano names and two-letter codes; (2) distance and direction of earthquake relative to volcano; and (3) the ability to link to Valve waveform displays.

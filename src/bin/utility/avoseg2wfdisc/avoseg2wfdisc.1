.TH AVOSEG2WFDISC 1 "$Date$"
.SH NAME
AVOSEG2WFDISC \- Create wfdisc table that points to AVO segmented waveform sac files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBavoseg2wfdisc \fP[-vf] dbin
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBavoseg2wfdisc\fP writes a wfdisc table which points to the segmented waveforms that accompany the events in dbin. By default the program will not overwrite or add to an existing database. The -f option overrides this. The program creates a symbolic link called avo_segmented_data that points to /Seis/Kiska4/data. Referencing the data through a link allows the resulting database to be portable away from the seis lab networks.
.LP
The critical input parameter (the only parameter!) is the origin database \fIdbin\fP. This is a specific style of hypocenter database used with AVO data. The AVO monthly and total databases include a remark table. This remark table is what allows the origin database to be tied to specific pick files and segment waveforms. (The process of pairing hypocenters with existing segmented waveforms is not a straight-forward as it might seem.) For \fBavoseg2wfdisc\fP to be successful, \fIdbin\fP must include this remark table. The best way to ensure that the remark table is included is to use the program \fBextractavodb\fP to prepare \fIdbin\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
-v verbose output

-f force \fBavoseg2wfdisc\fP to add wfidsc rows to an existing database. By default \fBavoseg2wfdisc\fP will not overwrite existing database.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
$ANTELOPE and $AVOSEIS must be set. 

.SH PARAMETER FILE
None.

.SH EXAMPLES
Make a wfdisc table that points to the segmented waveforms for AVO earthquakes larger than magnitude 3.0:

   extractavodb "1989-001" "now" dbBigEvents "ml>3.0"
   avoseg2wf dbBigEvents

.SH "SEE ALSO"
extractavodb(1)
.br  
sac2db(1)

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Parameters are hardwired instead of residing in a parameter file. While this matches the static structure of the pickfile directories on ther Seis Lab network, it does not allow for more generalized use. This code actually sends events to \fBsac2db\fP in batches of a few hundred. This is done to avoid exceeding the command line buffer size. It works fine but there is no actual testing of the command line length for compliance. \fBavoseg2wfdisc\fP assumes that the data for each origin is stored in the corresponding year_month directory, even for events that occur within seconds of the boundary. If this is not the case, \fBavoseg2wfdisc\fP may not include the affected waveforms.

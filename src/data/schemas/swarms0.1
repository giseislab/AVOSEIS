		Created 2010/06/17
		For storing auth, time, mean_rate, median_rate, mean_ml, cum_ml
	}
	Timedate lddate

Attribute auth
	String (15)
	Format ( "%-15s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "origin author" )
	Detail {
		This records the originator of an arrival (in arrival
		relation) or origin (in origin relation).  Possibilities
		include externally supplied arrivals identified according
		to their original source, such as WMO, NEIS, CAN(adian),
		UK(array), etc.  This may also be an identifier of an
		application generating the attribute, such as an automated
		interpretation or signal processing program.
	}
	;

Attribute timewindow_starttime
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "-9999999999.99900" )
	Units ( "Seconds" )
	Description ( "start time iof the time window" )
	Detail {
		end time of the timewindow used for computing mean_rate, median_rate, etc.
	}
	;

Attribute timewindow_endtime
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "9999999999.99900" )
	Units ( "Seconds" )
	Description ( "end time of the time window" )
	Detail {
		end time of the timewindow used for computing mean_rate, median_rate, etc.
	}
	;

Attribute mean_rate
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8ld" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "mean_rate >= 0" )
	Description ( "mean rate" )
	Detail {
		The mean rate is the average number of events per hour. If the timewindow is
		1 hour, then mean rate is the number of events that occurred in that hour.
		If there were 10 events in a 30 minute timewindow, the mean rate is 20.
	}
	;

Attribute median_rate
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8ld" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "median_rate >= 0" )
	Description ( "median rate" )
	Detail {
		The median rate is the reciprocal of the median hours between events.
		If there were 10 events in a 30 minute timewindow but all those events
		occurred in the last 10 minutes, the mean rate is 60. It is always
		greater than or equal to mean_rate.
	}
	;

Attribute mean_ml 
	Real (11)
	Format ( "%11.2f" )
	Null ( "-99999999.00" )
	Description ( "mean local magnitude" )
	Detail {
		The mean local magnitude is the average local magnitude (Ml) of events in the timewindow.
	}
	;

Attribute cum_ml
	Real (11)
	Format ( "%11.2f" )
	Null ( "-99999999.00" )
	Description ( "cumulative local magnitude" )
	Detail {
		The cumulative magnitude is the total seismic energy of all events in the timewindow.  
		expressed as a magnitude using a formula where energy is proportional to the
		10^(1.5*Ml). The cumulative energy of a sequence of events can be easily
		computed with this formula, and then converted back to an equivalent Ml.  
	}
	;

Attribute lddate
        Time (17)
        Format ( "%17.5f" )
        Null ( "-9999999999.99900" )
        Units ( "Seconds" )
        Description ( "(epoch) time of last record modification" )
        Detail {
                This is the last time the record was modified.
        }
        ;

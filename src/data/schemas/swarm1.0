	Null ( "-9999999999.99900" )
	Units ( "Seconds" )
	Description ( "start time iof the time window" )
	Detail {
		end time of the timewindow used for computing mean_rate, median_rate, etc.
	}
	;

Attribute endtime
	Time (17)
	Format ( "%17.5f" )
	Null ( "9999999999.99900" )
	Units ( "Seconds" )
	Description ( "end time of the time window" )
	Detail {
		end time of the timewindow used for computing mean_rate, median_rate, etc.
	}

Attribute mean_rate
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8ld" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "mean_rate >= 0" )
	Description ( "mean rate" )
	Detail {
		The mean rate is the average number of events per hour. If the timewindow is
		1 hour, then mean rate is the number of events that occurred in that hour.
		If there were 10 events in a 30 minute timewindow, the mean rate is 20.
	}
	;

Attribute median_rate
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8ld" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "median_rate >= 0" )
	Description ( "median rate" )
	Detail {
		The median rate is the reciprocal of the median hours between events.
		If there were 10 events in a 30 minute timewindow but all those events
		occurred in the last 10 minutes, the mean rate is 60. It is always
		greater than or equal to mean_rate.
	}
	;

Attribute mean_ml 
	Real (11)
	Format ( "%11.2f" )
	Null ( "-99999999.00" )
	Description ( "mean local magnitude" )
	Detail {
		The mean local magnitude is the average local magnitude (Ml) of events in the timewindow.
	}
	;

Attribute cum_ml
	Real (11)
	Format ( "%11.2f" )
	Null ( "-99999999.00" )
	Description ( "cumulative local magnitude" )
	Detail {
		The cumulative magnitude is the total seismic energy of all events in the timewindow.  
		expressed as a magnitude using a formula where energy is proportional to the
		10^(1.5*Ml). The cumulative energy of a sequence of events can be easily
		computed with this formula, and then converted back to an equivalent Ml.  
	}
	;

	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "level >= 0" )
	Description ( "highest swarm alarm level" )
	Detail {
		Records the highest swarm alarm level for a particular swarm. See also level. 
	}
	;

        Null ( "-9999999999.99900" )
        Units ( "Seconds" )
        Description ( "(epoch) time of last record modification" )
        Detail {
                This is the last time the record was modified.
        }
        ;

Attribute level
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8ld" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "level >= 0" )
	Description ( "swarm alarm level" )
	Detail {
		The swarm alarm level is an integer indicating the state of the swarm alarm
		system for a particular subnet. Level==0 indicates no swarm is in progress.
		Level==1 is a level 1 swarm. Level==2 means it is at level 2, etc.
	}
	;

Attribute num_quakes
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8ld" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "level >= 0" )
	Description ( "number of earthquakes" )
	Detail {
		The number of earthquakes in the swarm, regardless of whether a location was
		determined.
	}
	;

		The minimum local magnitude.
	}
	;

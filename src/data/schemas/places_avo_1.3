	    either an entire table or view, or to a contiguous subset
	    of some table or view.  In the former case, both the
	    record number and the field number should be dbALL.  In
	    the latter case, the record number and the field number
	    specify a range of records in the table.

	Description ( "Feature name" )
	Detail {
		This is the common name of the listed feature.
	}
	;

Attribute placetype
	String (20)
	Format ( "%-20s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "place type" )

Relation places
	Fields ( lat lon elev radius place placetype county state lddate )
	Primary ( lat lon place )
	Description ( "Geographic location of various features" )
	Detail {
		Geographic location of various features.  Includes 
		locations for various landmarks (ie summits, populated
		places-ppl, etc.).
	}
	;

Relation regions
	Fields (
		regname vertex lat lon
		)
	Primary ( regname vertex )
	Description ( "Vertices defining regions of interest" )
	Detail {
		This table specifies the vertex locations for the 
		polygons enclosing each region. The vertex field
		indicates the ordering of the vertices around the 
		polygon. For implementations which need to 
		distinguish unambiguously the difference between the 
		inside and outside of a region, usually for regions
		that include significant fractions of the globe or regions
		that might be on the far side of the globe from a 
		possibly included earthquake, the vertices should 
		be listed in clockwise order looking down at the 
		surface in map view. For situations in which there 
		may be several types of overlapping regions, or 
		overlapping regions which need to be ranked in 
		priority, additional tables should be defined in 
		an expansion schema.

This repository holds codes I developed while working for the AVO at the Seismic Lab at the University of Alaska Fairbanks from 11/2008-09/2012

## Update 2021/06
It would be good to reorganize these codes by project into their own repositories, so that they can be documented with wikis and have DOIs attached.
Most operate at the database level, so do not require a real-time Antelope license.

Examples:

AQMS catalog -> Antelope catalog
- aqms2db
- aqms2totaldb
- hypoinverse2db
- aqms2hypoinverse

FEAST
- carlstatrig2antelope
- carlsubtrig2antelope

VOLC2 (I think there is a separate repo)
- db2googlemaps

SWARM ALARM
- dbalarmdispatch
- dbdetectswarm/*
- replaydbdetectswarm
- diagnosticMonitoring (although used for other things too)
- Avoseis-AlarmManager/lib/Avoseis/AlarmManager.pm
- Avoseis-SwarmAlarm/lib/Avoseis/SwarmAlarm.pm
- Avoseis-SwarmTracker/lib/Avoseis/SwarmTracker.pm
- alarminfo.php
- confirm_alarms.php

COUNTING EVENTS, ARRIVALS, DETECTIONS etc
- dbcountdetections
- dbcounthourlydetections
- dbploteventratewrapper (Python)
- weeklysummarycounts2html

DATA MANAGEMENT
- dbsplit2dayvolumes (split Antelope db into day volumes)
- subset the AVO totaldb

LIBRARIES
- https://github.com/giseislab/AVOSEIS/blob/master/src/data/perl/Avoseis-Utils/lib/Avoseis/Utils.pm


REAL-TIME STUFF
- dbt2orbpf (rebroadcast db rows as pf packets)
- dbwatchtable (run command when a watched table changes)

SAUSAGEPLOT (python)
- sausageplot

ICEWEB/DATA QC
- soh.php

- Glenn Thompson
